## Output of MainCoroutines
The task "9" is good example:
* the http request sent by `worker-11` after this `worker-11` returned to pool
* `worker-11` processed result of tasks [3,2,1,10,4]
* the response of task "9" was processed by `worker-3`

More interesting output with coroutines debug option:
* task 6 is bounded to `@coroutine#7`
* first step of task 6 (send http request) executed on `worker-5`
* second step (recieved http response) executed on `worker-6`
